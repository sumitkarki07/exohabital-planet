      <p>
       <b>  Proxima Centauri b </b>likely developed under different conditions from Earth, with less water, stronger impacts, and an overall faster development, assuming that it formed at its current distance from the star. Proxima Centauri b probably did not form at its current distance to Proxima Centauri, as the amount of material in the protoplanetary disk would be insufficient.
       <br><br> Instead, the planet, or protoplanetary fragments, likely formed at larger distances and then migrated to the current orbit of Proxima Centauri b. Depending on the nature of the precursor material, it may be rich in volatiles. A number of different formation scenarios are possible, many of which depend on the existence of other planets around Proxima Centauri and which would result in different compositions.
  <br><br>
        Proxima Centauri b is located within the classical habitable zone of its star and receives about 65% of Earth's irradiation.

       <p> Discovered in 2019, GJ 357 d is a notable exoplanet in the constellation Hydra. This Neptune-like world orbits a red dwarf star, GJ 357, which is about 31 light-years away from Earth. GJ 357 d possesses a mass approximately 6.1 times that of Earth, suggesting it's a substantial exoplanet.
        <br><br> It completes one orbit around its host star in just 55.7 days, and it's situated at a distance of approximately 0.204 astronomical units from its star, making it a relatively close-in exoplanet.
        <br><br>Its Neptune-like classification implies potential similarities in composition and characteristics to our solar system's ice giant Neptune. This discovery adds to our understanding of diverse exoplanetary systems beyond our own.
