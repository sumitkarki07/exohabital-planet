            <div class="short-info1">
              Astra-458 Y  boasts a balanced atmosphere, with 70% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, and 0.04% carbon dioxide, creating stable 
              conditions for life. Trace gases like water vapor and noble gases contribute to atmospheric stability. An ozone layer shields
               the surface from harmful UV radiation, while unique traces of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide sustain specialized extremophile
                ecosystems. This carefully crafted composition supports diverse life forms and maintains habitable conditions within the planet's
                 habitable zone.<br><br>

            <h2>AQUATIC LIFE</h2>
            <p>
              In a habitable exoplanet with approximately 80 percent water, a diverse range of aquatic life could potentially exist. Microbial life would likely dominate, including bacteria, archaea, and various single-celled organisms adapted to the planet's specific conditions. These microbes might serve as the foundation of the aquatic food web, supporting higher trophic levels.<br><br>

Beyond microorganisms, the oceans of such a planet could harbor a wide variety of marine life, including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and other aquatic animals. The specific species and their adaptations would depend on the planet's environmental factors, such as temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability.<br><br>

If the planet has diverse aquatic habitats, it could support ecosystems like coral reefs, kelp forests, and hydrothermal vent communities, each with their unique assemblages of species. Intelligent aquatic life, while speculative, is not entirely out of the question, as complex organisms might evolve in the planet's oceans, potentially displaying advanced behaviors and problem-solving abilities. Ultimately, the nature and extent of aquatic life would be shaped by the planet's unique conditions and evolutionary history.<br><br>

            <h2>TERRESTRIAL LIFE</h2>
            <p>
              On a habitable exoplanet with approximately 80 percent water, terrestrial life could exist in regions where land and water intersect, such as coastlines, islands, wetlands, and potentially even archipelagos. These transitional zones between land and water would be prime locations for various forms of terrestrial organisms to thrive.<br><br>

Terrestrial life might include a range of plants, from salt-tolerant coastal flora to wetland vegetation. Insects and birds adapted to coastal environments could play essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal. Coastal and island ecosystems might host reptiles and amphibians, while larger islands and archipelagos could support mammals.<br><br>

Islands in the planet's oceans could serve as isolated laboratories for evolutionary processes, giving rise to unique and endemic species. Wetlands, swamps, and marshes would be rich in biodiversity, providing critical habitat for waterfowl and amphibians.<br><br>

The specific types of terrestrial life would depend on the planet's geological history, climate, and the availability of resources. These regions of intersection between land and water would likely be dynamic and ecologically rich, contributing to the planet's overall biodiversity.<br><br>
